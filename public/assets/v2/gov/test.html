        <h2 class="entry-title">Welcome!</h2> Does this page look like being hosted on http://www2.gov.bc.ca? If you
        think so, then my goal is partially achieved! Actually, the page is generated from a static HTML file of which
        source is available <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/MyGovBC-core-headerFooterService/blob/master/public/assets/v2/gov/test.html">here</a>. Looking at the source, you'll find it only contains this "Welcome" paragragh. Then
        where does the header (all stuff before this paragragh) and footer (all stuff afterwards) come from? The answer
        is this JS block:
        <pre>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/v2/gov/&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    unippear({
        headerContainer: &apos;#wrappe&apos;,
        footerContainer: &apos;#wrapper&apos;,
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
          Additonal options when calling unippear can be found <a href='https://github.com/bcgov/MyGovBC-core-headerFooterService/blob/master/public/assets/v2/gov/README.md'>here</a>.
        </p>
        Factoring header, footer and associated assets (CSS, JS, img etc) out of a document isn't new. Almost all
        template engines are capable of. But those template engines are platform specific and thus only work for one
        website. Unipear turns the layout into a service to make it shareable among multiple websites. If this is of interest to you, return to <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/MyGovBC-core-headerFooterService">MyGovBC-core-headerFooterService</a> and keep reading. You may also find <a href='https://github.com/abbr/unippear'>Unippear</a> docs to be useful.
